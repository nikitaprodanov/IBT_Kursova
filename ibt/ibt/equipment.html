      <p>Though workouts can be done without involving any type of device, adding some equipment can provide some extra 
        perks to the body. <br> Though the machine based workouts may seem intimidating at first, people can adjust them according 
        to their preferences based on levels of difficulty or even speed. <br> It is always advised to start slow and then increase 
        the intensity accordingly as and when the body adjusts. <br> With the COVID-19 situation still at large on a global level, 
        people have adapted to having routines at home, which has led to them also purchasing at least the basic equipment. 
        <br> A report published by Research Dive stated that the global fitness equipment market is predicted to gain significant 
        revenue of $15,762.41 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2021-2028.
        <br><br><br>
        Also, since gyms and fitness centers are closed due to the pandemic in 2020, many enthusiasts 
        have also enrolled into online courses and workout sessions, where experts also provide inputs. <br>
        Due to this, a beginner in working out with equipment can also gain a perspective about using them. 
        The trainers help the trainee with giving them in-depth view of using machines by also explaining the 
        path of motion that can help target the right muscle group for maximum benefits. Apart from working on the 
        muscles, equipment also help in building muscle strength by exhausting them which after a certain point, builds power 
        within and helps increase their size. <br><br><br> </p>
